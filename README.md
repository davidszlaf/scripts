# scripts
in order to run the script you may need to:
1 the password script- you will run the script followed by a password that you want to check, and the script will indicate if the password is strong or not.
2 the task-scheduler script- you will run the Task-Scehdular2.ps1 script which will automaticly run another script print to a text file that I love this course, in addition it will check status of tasks.
